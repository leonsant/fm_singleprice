# fm_singleprice

This is my answer to the "Single price grid component" challenge, from FrontEnd Menthor.

It is the first challenge I do in this site, because I've just started learning, and I loved doing it! :)

Certainly there are things that could be better.

I chose not to have more than one class in the HTML elements. I know that people do that (when there is no LESS) to reduce duplications, but, I don't like the solution of using multiple classes, because I think it makes it harder to figure out where some styling rule come from. Just a newbie opinion :)
